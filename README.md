A Chrome Extension that shows the list of emotes available on a twitch chat (Global and Subs).

# Introduction and Inspiration

Everytime i want to send an emote on Twitch-chat i have to hover my mouse on 
some emote sent by another user. 
There are too many emotes and i can't remember how to write them correctly.

This extension adds a new icon on the send-message box that list all emoticons
in lexical ordering.
